## How it works

This circuit is a digital amplifier built using only simple logic gates. It cancels out unwanted noise and boosts the desired signal, much like noise-canceling headphones. Its digital nature simplifies integration and automated design.

## How to test

Entering voltage through the input
## External hardware

No external hardware used
